# Sine-and-cosine-computation-results
Sequential code - SineACosine.cpp, which computes the sine and cosine series sequentially.
Parallelised code(using Pthreads) - SinaCosPthreads.cpp,  which computes the sine and cosine series parallely using the number of threads as 4(which can be changed accordingly to the efficiency of a laptop core).
